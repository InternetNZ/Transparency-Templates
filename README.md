# Transparency-Templates
The public repository for InternetNZ's transparency templates and resources

## What is Easy Transparency? ##
Easy Transparency is a set of tools to make it easy for New Zealand
organisations to start doing transparency reporting.
Â 
Version One includes:
  * a template Transparency Policy for your organisation to use
  * a template Transparency Report for your organisation to use to report annually
  * supporting documentation  
  * a spreadsheet for recording enquiries and generating graphs for your report.

We are keen to develop these resources further in the future. If you have any comments or suggested changes, please use this github repository.

## Users guide to the templates ##
Text in *italics* is guidance and explanatory notes for you, the organisation that is using the template and should be removed "before flight".

As a template, the content is designed to work as a stand-alone. You can simply delete the italics, add in your company name in a few places and then publish. However, as a template you can obviously change content, add content or whatever as you see fit.

## Licencing ##
The licence for these transparency tools is a CC0 1.0 Universal licence. Please see the **Licence** file in this repository for further information.
