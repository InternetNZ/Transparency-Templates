# Transparency-Templates
This is a set of templates for the production of a transparency report that complies with New Zealand law with template sections for the various NZ agencies that may request data.

## What is a transparency report? ##
Many organisations find themselves subject to requests for user data from a variety of agencies.  A transparency report is a way for a company report on those requests and so inform their customers and wider stakeholders about the security of their data and how they respond to such requests.

## Why does this matter to InternetNZ? ##
InternetNZ believes that use of the Internet depends on confidence that the Internet is a safe place for personal or otherwise confidential data to be held.  That confidence can best be determined by all companies and organisations that hold such data providing information on how they protect it, under what circumstances they share it and to whom.  Transparency reports are an emerging global standard for publishing that information.

## What does this repository include? ##
Version One includes:
  * a template Transparency Policy for your organisation to use
  * a template Transparency Report for your organisation to use to report annually
  * supporting documentation  
  * a spreadsheet for recording enquiries and generating graphs for your report.

We are keen to develop these resources further in the future. If you have any comments or suggested changes, please use this github repository.

## Users guide to the templates ##
Text in *italics* is guidance and explanatory notes for you, the organisation that is using the template and should be removed "before flight".

As a template, the content is designed to work as a stand-alone. You can simply delete the italics, add in your company name in a few places and then publish. However, as a template you can obviously change content, add content or whatever as you see fit.

## Licencing ##
The licence for these transparency tools is a CC0 1.0 Universal licence. Please see the **Licence** file in this repository for further information.
